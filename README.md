## Project Overview
The Furniture Sales Overview Dashboard is a comprehensive analytical tool that presents key insights into sales performance, shipping patterns, and regional distribution across the United States. The dashboard was developed using Microsoft Excel and integrates dynamic charts, key performance indicators, and interactive filters. Its purpose is to help business stakeholders and decision-makers understand trends, identify opportunities, and improve performance through data visualization.
This project demonstrates how Excel can be used to build business intelligence dashboards that consolidate complex datasets into a clear and interactive reporting system.

## Dataset Description
The dataset captures transactional details about furniture sales, customer segments, and shipping information across multiple U.S. regions.
The dataset includes the following fields:
Order Date, which represents the date when each order was placed.
Ship Date, which records when the product was shipped.
Ship Mode, which specifies the shipping type such as Standard Class, Second Class, First Class, or Same Day.
Category, which identifies the product category, including Chairs, Tables, Bookcases, and Furnishings.
State and City, which indicate the geographical locations of each order.
Sales, representing the total sales amount in U.S. dollars.
Quantity, showing the number of items sold.
Profit, showing the profit earned from each transaction.

## Business Objectives
The dashboard was created to achieve several business objectives.
First, it provides an overview of overall sales performance and growth trends.
Second, it identifies which product categories contribute most to revenue and profitability.
Third, it evaluates shipping efficiency and delivery times.
Fourth, it highlights regional sales distribution to determine which states and cities generate the highest revenue.
Finally, it helps management make informed decisions through concise and data-driven insights.

## Key Insights
 # Overall Performance
Sales amounted to 215.4 thousand dollars, representing an eight percent increase from the previous year. A total of 2.4 thousand units were sold, reflecting an eleven percent increase in quantity. However, total profit decreased to 3.0 thousand dollars, a decline of fifty-seven percent year over year.
The data suggests that while the company achieved sales growth and higher order volume, operational costs or discounting strategies might have negatively affected profitability.

 # Sales Trend
The highest sales month was December, with 121.82 thousand dollars in revenue. Sales performance showed consistent improvement through the year with notable growth in the last quarter. This pattern suggests strong end-of-year consumer demand, possibly driven by holiday-related purchases.

 # Shipping Analysis
Standard Class was the most used shipping method, accounting for fifty-nine percent of all orders. Second Class represented fifteen percent, First Class twenty percent, and Same Day six percent.
Most orders, about twenty-eight percent, were delivered within four days. The majority of shipments arrived between four and five days, showing that delivery operations are generally efficient and consistent with customer expectations.

 # Product Category Performance
Chairs generated the highest sales with 328.4 thousand dollars, followed by Tables with 207.0 thousand dollars, Bookcases with 114.9 thousand dollars, and Furnishings with 91.7 thousand dollars. Chairs clearly represent the strongest product category and provide the largest contribution to total sales.

 # Regional and City-Level Performance
California recorded the highest sales among all states with 156.1 thousand dollars.
New York City led at the city level with 75.7 thousand dollars, followed by Los Angeles with 54.0 thousand, Seattle with 41.0 thousand, San Francisco with 36.4 thousand, and Philadelphia with 36.5 thousand.
The data shows that urban centers, particularly in the East and West regions, generate the majority of revenue.

## Dashboard Components
The Furniture Sales Overview Dashboard includes multiple interconnected visual elements. It features key performance indicators for sales, quantity, and profit, each showing year-over-year comparisons. A line chart presents monthly sales trends, while a donut chart illustrates shipping mode distribution. Bar charts display sales by product category and by city. A map visual provides an overview of state-level performance across the United States.
Interactive slicers allow users to filter data by customer segment, including Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office, as well as by regional categories such as Central, East, South, and West. The dashboard’s layout uses consistent colors, clear typography, and rounded panels for a professional and readable presentation.

## Tools and Techniques Used
Microsoft Excel was the primary tool used for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Pivot tables and pivot charts were used to summarize and display sales performance. Slicers and timelines were added to introduce interactivity. Conditional formatting was applied to highlight year-over-year changes in key metrics. Named ranges and linked formulas were used to automate summary values and ensure data consistency.
The design was guided by principles of simplicity and clarity, with a uniform color scheme and clear visual hierarchy to emphasize the most important information.

## Analytical Insights
The dashboard reveals several important findings.
Revenue increased compared to the previous year, but profitability declined, suggesting a need to reassess pricing or cost structures.
Standard shipping remains the preferred mode, which implies that most customers value cost-effectiveness over delivery speed.
Urban regions such as New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco drive a significant share of total sales.
Finally, the end-of-year surge in sales highlights the importance of seasonal planning and targeted marketing strategies.

## Conclusion
The Furniture Sales Overview Dashboard provides a clear and data-driven understanding of sales and operational performance. By combining financial, geographical, and logistical insights, it helps management identify key growth areas, improve supply chain decisions, and enhance profitability.
This project demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be used to build an effective business intelligence tool that translates raw data into actionable insights and professional visual reporting.
